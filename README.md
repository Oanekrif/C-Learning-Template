This C Language Learning Template outlines a comprehensive roadmap for mastering C programming, starting with the basics and advancing to complex concepts. The template covers multiple topics, organized systematically, for a thorough understanding of C, and includes practical problems to help reinforce learning.

<br><br>

# Description:
The C Language Learning Template provides a detailed guide divided into key sections, starting with an introduction to C, followed by fundamental concepts such as data types, operators, decision-making, loops, and functions. Each section contains theoretical content and practical programming problems aimed at enhancing your problem-solving skills.

<br>

1. `C Basics`: An introduction to the essential syntax, functions, variables, constants, and the basic structure of a C program. Early practice problems help you get started with writing simple programs.
2. `Operators`: Covers arithmetic, relational, logical, bitwise operators, and operator precedence, with problems involving real-world applications like calculating zakat or time conversion.
3. `Decision Making`: Explains how to make decisions in programs using if, switch, and ternary operators. Practical problems involve creating simple calculators and date/month name outputs.
4. `Loops`: Introduces loop structures like for, while, do-while, and nested loops, with examples like generating multiplication tables or printing pyramid shapes.
5. `Pointers`: A key concept in C, teaching memory addresses, dereferencing, pointer arithmetic, and the difference between call-by-value and call-by-reference. Hands-on problems illustrate how pointers work with functions.
6. `Arrays`: Covers the use of arrays, including 1D and 2D arrays, initialization, pointer manipulation with arrays, and multi-dimensional array operations.
7. `Strings`: Focuses on string manipulation, including functions from the string.h library, and challenges such as calculating string length and reversing strings using pointers.
8. `Functions`: Detailed exploration of function definitions, function calls, recursion, and passing arrays/pointers. Problems help you practice concepts like swap functions and arithmetic operation handling using function pointers.
9. `Dynamic Memory Allocation`: Introduces malloc, calloc, realloc, and memory management issues such as memory leaks and dangling pointers. Practical problems include dynamically allocating memory for user input and manipulating arrays.
10. `Data Structures in C`: Explains structures, unions, and enumerations in C, with practical problems like handling mixed-type data and performing operations using structures.
11. `File Handling`: Teaches how to work with files in C, including reading and writing data, using macros like __FILE__, and handling file errors with examples.
12. `Program Execution Process and Keywords`: Covers the compilation process, including the role of the preprocessor, assembler, and linker, and explores C keywords and standard library headers.
